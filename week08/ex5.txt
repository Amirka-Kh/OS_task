Virtual Memory is like image derived from Physical Memory domain. There is MMU performs
these mappings, but it is bigger (it makes an illusion to users of a larger memory).

Also VM is slower than PM because Virtual Memory should determine the real address of 
application in Physical Memory. MMU takes that responsibility.

Virtual Memory cannot directly access to the CPU, while Physical Memory can.

Virtual Memory makes applications think that they are running in their address space, 
while in a physical memory they have different addresses. VM makes application\program 
self-contained (does not overwrite other application memory space), solve issue with
memory allocating (MMU and OS make sure that map from VM to Physical Memory goes right).
