So, our virtual address consist of 16 bits:
_ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _  

Because our pages are 8 KB, there is should
be 13 offset bits. For example, we want access 
6409 address, to do that represent that number 
we need 13 bits. 
1 1001 0000 1001 
13 bits let us access any address in the 
diapason of 8KB.

So, we left with 3 bits for index. 
With 3 bits we can have 8 variants.

Therefore, the answer is 8 entities
