- How to manipulate with evolutionary algorithm

## Which libraries were be applied 
In this project were *numpy* and *cv2* libraries. To have cv2 libraries
you should install OpenCv packages. Below you can find an appropriate link.

- [cv2](https://opencv.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

OpenCV is an open source computer vision library for image analysis, 
classification and processing. Numpy supports for multidimensional arrays; 
supports for high-level math functions designed to work with multidimensional arrays.

## How to evolve my own image
Unfortunately, we did not made an opportunity to set everything by input.
You will need manually change every record in the code. Luckily, there is not
many things to change.

To set your image, you should get path to image location and set to ***img_path***
variable. In this example *baboon.jpg* and original code are in the same directory.
Therefore, I specified only the file name.

## How to manipulate with evolutionary algorithm
Back to the code. There is a section called *variables to be changed for personal benefit, 
evolution settings*, under that you have set of variables you can change, such as mutation
rate, population size, number of figures presented on an image, initial start figure.
